            Admin portal pages for DfT have been updated on BODS with functionality
            including searchable text boxes and sorting functions across organisation
            management, agent management and consumer management. This will enable
            easier and more convenient navigation on the admin portal for DfT.

            The team has also worked on updating the download metrics on the platform.
            This will enable the DfT to truly track the utilisation of BODS and work
            with consumers to ensure higher adoption/usage of the platform.

            A bulk of technical debts accrued over the past year have now been improved.
            This means the code base on BODS is cleaned up which will enable a better
            functioning overall platform.

            Updates have been made to the developer documentation on Find BODS pages which
            adds more details on GTFS formats available on the platform. The documentation
            for data quality is now also updated to reflect the accurate description of
            how data quality is measured on BODS. Both these changes will enable more
            guidance and transparency on the features available on the platform.
