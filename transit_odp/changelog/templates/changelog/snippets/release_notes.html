            The OTC database is now being ingested by the Bus Open Data Service to improve
            data quality. Service Codes will be validated against the Registration number
            from the OTC database. Updating this validation check will measure an operatorâ€™s
            compliance per registered service and hence must contain the relevant OTC
            Registration number.
