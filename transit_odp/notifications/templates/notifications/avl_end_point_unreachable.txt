Hello,

The below SIRI-VM data feed is no longer sending data to the Bus Open Data Service.

{{ data_feed_name }} - {{ data_feed_id }}
Short Description: {{ feed_short_description }}

This data set will be marked as having no vehicle activity to developers until the SIRI-VM service is resumed. This may be expected if services are not currently running for your operator, if this is the case then no further action is required.

If you believe you have services running but they arenâ€™t appearing on your bus location data feed, then please contact your ticket machine supplier.

You can opt out of this notification from here {{ settings_link }}.

Kind regards,
Bus Open Data Service
