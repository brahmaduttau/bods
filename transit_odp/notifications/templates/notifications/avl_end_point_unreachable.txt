Hello,

The below SIRI-VM data feed is no longer sending data to the Bus Open Data Service.

{{ data_feed_name }} - {{ data_feed_id }}

This data set will be marked as unavailable to developers until the SIRI-VM service is resumed. This may be expected if services are not currently running for your operator, if this is the case then no action is required.

You can opt out of this notification from here {{ settings_link }}.

Kind regards,
Bus Open Data Service
