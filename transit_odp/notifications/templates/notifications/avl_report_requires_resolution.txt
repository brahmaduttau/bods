Hello,

The following data feed on the Bus Open Data service has been flagged as having errors in the SIRI-VM validation report.

Please note it is your legal obligation to provide compliant SIRI-VM data feeds in line with the DfT SIRI-VM profile.

The SIRI-VM validator checks for mandatory fields specified within the DfT BODS profile, to support consistent SIRI-VM 2.0 output. The validator runs one randomised check per day of the provided feed over a 7-day period.

Any outstanding errors still present after the 7-day validation period, would mean your feed would be labelled as non-compliant/partially compliant. If you do not know how to resolve your validation issues, please reach out to your SIRI-VM supplier.
